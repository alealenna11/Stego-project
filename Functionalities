✅ Requirements you have satisfied
Core Steganography

GUI-based LSB Replacement steganography & steganalysis program

✅ You have a Tkinter GUI (gui.py + run_gui.py) with encoding/decoding workflows.

✅ Supports preview of cover/stego images, and file dialogs.

Support for multiple cover types

✅ Images (.png/.bmp/.jpg/.jpeg)

✅ GIFs (first frame)

✅ Videos (.mp4/.avi, first frame)

✅ Audio (.wav, 16-bit PCM)

That’s 4 cover object types—well beyond “at least 1 image + 1 audio”.

Support for arbitrary payload files (text, image, PDF, exe, etc.)

✅ Your encode_* functions just read raw bytes of any file, so any payload type works.

User-provided key required

✅ Password box included in GUI, passed into encode/decode functions.

✅ Key influences LSB embedding order via permutation (rng_indices).

Select number of LSBs (1–8)

✅ Spinbox in GUI for lsb_depth (1–8).

✅ Core respects this in both image and audio encoding.

Capacity calculation + warning

✅ Implemented for images and WAV files (update_capacity).

⚠ For GIF/Video you show “(not shown for GIF/Video)”, which is acceptable unless explicitly required.

Error handling for oversized payloads

✅ You check if total_bits_needed > capacity: raise ValueError.

Display/playback of cover & stego

✅ Images shown side by side.

✅ WAV supported as cover/stego file (can be played externally).

⚠ GIF/Video aren’t previewed yet (just filename label). Basic support exists but no playback inside GUI.

Encryption & integrity check

✅ ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption if password used.

✅ SHA-256 verification in decode.

Drag & drop / file explorer selection

✅ Implemented via Tkinter filedialog (explorer-style).

⚠ Drag-and-drop is not yet added (only dialog browsing).

⚠ Requirements partially covered

(4) Selection of embedding location (mouse click / drag-drop into image region)
➝ ❌ Not implemented yet. Currently everything starts at channel 0 with permutation after header.
(Non-basic requirement → optional bonus.)

(8) Play payload directly in GUI
➝ ❌ Currently payloads are only saved. GUI doesn’t “play audio” or “open PDF/image/text” inline.
(But external open works, which may be acceptable for demo.)

(9) Visualization (difference map / waveform comparison)
➝ ❌ You have visualize.py with diff_map, but it’s not wired into GUI.
(Non-basic but good for demo points.)

❌ Requirements not yet covered

Innovation bonus (e.g. MP4 multi-frame embedding, full steganalysis, key distribution)
➝ ❌ You currently only embed in the first frame for GIF/Video. Full multi-frame hiding = optional innovation mark.
➝ ❌ No additional steganalysis (diff map isn’t integrated in GUI yet).
